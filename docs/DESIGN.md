# Design System: 10-typing-speed-trainer

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **TypoModern 2026 / Technical Minimalist** aesthetic. It uses a deep charcoal and amber palette with extreme focus on legibility and subtle micro-animations.

## Design Patterns
-   **Interactive Caret**: A layout-animated underline highlighting the current active word.
-   **Glassmorphic Overlays**: Test results presented on a blurred backdrop for "completion focus".
-   **Dynamic Typography**: High contrast between active (white) and inactive (zinc-600) words.

## Color Palette
-   **Deep Void**: Zinc-950 (#09090b)
-   **Test Surface**: Zinc-900/20 (#18181b)
-   **Primary (Amber)**: Yellow-500 (#eab308)
-   **Text High**: Zinc-100 (#f4f4f5)
-   **Text Muted**: Zinc-600 (#52525b)

## Interaction Design
-   **Seamless Input**: Auto-focus management ensures the user is always ready to type.
-   **Visual Feedback**: Red underscores for errors; yellow highlight for active words.
-   **Celebratory Success**: Confetti burst on target completion to reinforce positive performance.
